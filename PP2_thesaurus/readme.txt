This program creates a putative thesaurus based on words in the english language
and a set of keywords that the definitions must contain. The dictionary used is
the NLTK wordnet dictionary.

Note: this program took ~3 minutes to complete a thesaurus with 9 catagories
when checking matches for same part of speech. The machine it ran on was a Dell
laptop from ~2018 with 4 cores and 8 threads. On the same machine, not checking
for equivalent parts of speech, the same program ran in ~1 minute.
