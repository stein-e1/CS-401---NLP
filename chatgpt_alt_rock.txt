In a quiet pond, beneath the willow's shade
A little duckling dreams, in a world well-made
With feathers of innocence, it takes to the water
A journey of discovery, a life that's bound to alter
The duck's journey, in ripples it begins
A story of wonder, where the river wins
With every quack and every dive
In the duck's journey, it learns to thrive
Through reeds and rushes, it wades so deep
The secrets of the pond, in its heart, it'll keep
With waves of curiosity, and a thirst to explore
In the duck's journey, there's always more
The duck's journey, in ripples it begins
A story of wonder, where the river wins
With every quack and every dive
In the duck's journey, it learns to thrive

A man stands alone, in the rain he cries
Grieving for lost love, under gray skies
With tears that fall like heavy rain
In the silence of sorrow, he feels the pain
Grieving echoes, in the pouring rain
Memories linger, they're a relentless chain
With each teardrop, a piece of his soul
In the grieving echoes, he'll find his role
In the darkest hour, his heart aches
As he reflects on the love he forsakes
In the echoes of what once was
In his grieving heart, he'll find his cause
Grieving echoes, in the pouring rain
Memories linger, they're a relentless chain
With each teardrop, a piece of his soul
In the grieving echoes, he'll find his role

Snowflakes fall, and the world turns white
In the quiet night, a shimmering sight
With Christmas lights and a warm embrace
In the season of love, a familiar grace
Christmas lights, in the winter's glow
In the hearth's warmth, love will flow
With laughter and joy, we'll celebrate
In the Christmas lights, it's never too late
The tree adorned with ornaments so bright
In the glow of love, we'll light up the night
With carols sung and hearts so light
In the Christmas lights, we'll find our flight
Christmas lights, in the winter's glow
In the hearth's warmth, love will flow
With laughter and joy, we'll celebrate
In the Christmas lights, it's never too late

In a world divided, where hearts should unite
Sexism's poison, in the name of might
We'll rise against it, a battle to wage
In this song of defiance, we'll turn the page
Breaking chains, shattering the mold
In the face of oppression, we'll stand bold
Equality's our anthem, a powerful refrain
In the fight against sexism, we'll break the chain
We'll challenge norms and stereotypes
With strength and unity, we'll win our fights
No longer silenced, our voices rise
In this battle against sexism, we claim the prize
Breaking chains, shattering the mold
In the face of oppression, we'll stand bold
Equality's our anthem, a powerful refrain
In the fight against sexism, we'll break the chain

In the heart of the woods, where the trees stand tall
A symphony of life, a mystical call
The rustling leaves and the wind's gentle sigh
In the whispers of the woods, we'll touch the sky
Whispers of the woods, secrets untold
In the realm of nature, where stories unfold
With creatures unseen and tales to explore
In the whispers of the woods, we'll find our core
In the dappled light, where shadows play
In the arms of the trees, we'll find our way
The ancient wisdom, a gift from the land
In the whispers of the woods, we'll understand
Whispers of the woods, secrets untold
In the realm of nature, where stories unfold
With creatures unseen and tales to explore
In the whispers of the woods, we'll find our core
