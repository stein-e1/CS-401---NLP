In a pond so dark, where shadows creep
A solitary duck takes a fateful leap
With feathers black as night, and eyes that gleam
A creature of the water, living its dream
Quack of the duck, on the water's skin
In the moonlight's glow, its journey begins
With ripples in the night, it swims so free
In the quack of the duck, its spirit is the key
Beneath the stars, it calls its name
A creature of the night, in this watery game
Its beak cuts through, like a blade so keen
In the quack of the duck, its power unseen
Quack of the duck, on the water's skin
In the moonlight's glow, its journey begins
With ripples in the night, it swims so free
In the quack of the duck, its spirit is the key

A man in shadows, his heart turned cold
In the depths of sorrow, his story unfolds
With tears in his eyes, and grief in his soul
In the blackest night, he seeks to be whole
Grieving shadows, a heavy weight
In the depths of despair, he carries his fate
With memories haunting, his heart's refrain
In the grieving shadows, he's bound by the pain
He screams in silence, his voice unheard
In the realm of sorrow, he's a caged bird
With darkness as his only friend
In the grieving shadows, his spirit will mend
Grieving shadows, a heavy weight
In the depths of despair, he carries his fate
With memories haunting, his heart's refrain
In the grieving shadows, he's bound by the pain

Snowflakes fall, the world turns white
In the silent night, it's a magical sight
A Christmas tree with lights so bright
In the frosty embrace, hearts take flight
Frosty embrace, the season's grace
In the warmth of love, we find our place
With family and friends, we celebrate
In the frosty embrace, it's never too late
Candles flicker, a choir's song
In this festive moment, we all belong
With gifts to share and love to bestow
In the frosty embrace, our spirits aglow
Frosty embrace, the season's grace
In the warmth of love, we find our place
With family and friends, we celebrate
In the frosty embrace, it's never too late

In a world divided, where hatred thrives
Sexism's poison, in countless lives
We rise against it, a battle to wage
In this song of defiance, we turn the page
Break the chains, shatter the mold
In the face of oppression, we stand bold
Equality's our anthem, a powerful refrain
In the fight against sexism, we'll break the chain
We'll challenge norms and stereotypes
With strength and unity, we'll win our fights
No longer silenced, our voices rise
In this battle against sexism, we claim the prize
Break the chains, shatter the mold
In the face of oppression, we stand bold
Equality's our anthem, a powerful refrain
In the fight against sexism, we'll break the chain

In the heart of the woods, where the trees stand tall
A symphony of life, a mystical call
The rustling leaves and the wind's gentle breath
In the whispers of the forest, we find our depth
Whispers of the forest, secrets untold
In the realm of nature, where stories unfold
With creatures unseen and tales to explore
In the whispers of the forest, we'll open the door
In the dappled light, where the shadows play
In the arms of the trees, we'll find our way
The ancient wisdom, a gift from the land
In the whispers of the forest, we'll understand
Whispers of the forest, secrets untold
In the realm of nature, where stories unfold
With creatures unseen and tales to explore
In the whispers of the forest, we'll open the door
